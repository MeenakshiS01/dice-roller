# ðŸŽ² Dice Roller Game in Python

This is a simple, beginner-friendly Python program that simulates rolling two dice using the random module. The user can roll the dice repeatedly by entering 'y' or stop the game by entering 'n'. The program also handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Built with basic Python syntax
- Uses while loop for repeated execution
- Accepts user input with validation
- Uses random.randint() to simulate dice values
- Designed to be simple, interactive, and console-based

---

## ðŸ“œ How It Works

1. The program asks: *"Roll the dice? (y/n):"*
2. If the user types y or Y, two random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated and printed.
3. If the user types n or N, the game ends with a thank you message.
4. For any other input, it prints: "Invalid choice.."
